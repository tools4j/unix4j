	This filter displays the first <i>count</i> lines or characters of each of
	the specified files, or of the standard input if no files are specified. If 
	<i>count</i> is omitted it defaults to 10. Both line and character counts 
	start from 1.

    If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a header
    consisting of the string {@code "==> XXX <=="} where {@code "XXX"} is the
