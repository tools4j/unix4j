The xargs utility reads items from the standard input, delimited by blanks 
(which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or 
newlines, and executes the command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with
any initial arguments followed by items read from standard input. Blank lines on
the standard input are ignored.
</p>
<p>
Because Unix filenames can contain blanks and newlines, this default behaviour 
is often problematic; filenames containing blanks and/or newlines are 
incorrectly processed by xargs. In these situations it is better to use the 
--null option, which prevents such problems. When using this option you will 
need to ensure that the program which produces the input for xargs also uses a 
null character as a separator. If that program is find for example, the --print0 
option does this for you.

If any invocation of the command exits with a status of 255, xargs will stop 
immediately without reading any further input. An error message
is issued on stderr when this happens.
