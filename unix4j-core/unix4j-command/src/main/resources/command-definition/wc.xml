		<method args="args" usesStandardInput="true">
			One or several counts are executed and written to the standard 
			output. Counts include lines, words and chars (depending on the

			displayed on a separate line after the output for the last file if
			more than one input file is specified. 

			Options can be specified by acronym (with a leading dash "-") or by 
			long name (with two leading dashes "--"). Operands other than the 
			default "--paths" operand have to be prefixed with the operand 
			name.

			Executes a count of lines, words and chars contained in each input
			file and writes them to the standard output. If more than one input
